Chlosyne lacinia 2023-2024 Project ReadMe

This github project corresponds to my second dissertation chapter regarding the effect of larval sodium access on adult mating behavior in C. lacinia. In this project folder,
there will be a raw data file, a manipulated data file, a metadata document, and my R scripts used to run my analyses.

Files and descriptions:

2023_choice_trials_subset.csv: a subset of the "raw_data" file with only the Choice trial data
2023_choice_trials_subset_HH_removed.csv: the "2023_choice_trials_subset" with one entry removed, the single High-Sodium x High-Sodium pairing. This was used for analysis
2024_4_2_modeling.Rmd: R script for the ANOVAs, using "2023_choice_trials_subset_HH_removed" and "choice_f2_fitness_data_HH_removed"
all_mate_no_mate_CL.csv: the mating vs. not mating outcomes for both the Choice and No Choice trials
c_lac_mapping.Rmd: R script for creating a map of the C. lacinia collection sites, uses files "colony_1_coordinates.csv" and "colony_2_coordinates.csv"
chi_squared_code.Rmd: the Chi squared code, uses the files "all_mate_no_mate_CL.csv" and "chi_treatment_choice_numeric.csv"
choice_f2_fitness_data.csv: a subset of the "raw_data" file with only the Choice trial fitness data
choice_f2_fitness_data_HH_removed: the "choice_f2_fitness_data.csv" with one entry removed, the single High-Sodium x High-Sodium pairing
colony_1_coordinates.csv: the latitude and longitude of the C. lacinia populations from Texas used in the Choice trials
colony_2_coordinates.csv: the latitude and longitude of the C. lacinia populations from Texas used in the No Choice trials
metadata.docx: a document detailing the experiment
raw_data.xlsx: the original data file
